                <p>Now, let's dive deeper into how we identify intervals in music.</p>

            <ArticleHeading heading="How to Identify Intervals on a Staff" bottom="mb-16" />
            <section className="px-5 lg:px-36 xl:px-64 mb-20">
                <p className="leading-8 mb-10">First, let's look at how to identify intervals we can see visually on the music staff. The secret to doing this lies in the major scale. To demonstrate, we are going to use our favourite beginner-friendly scale - the "C Major". Here it is for reference:</p>
                <figure className="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col justify-center items-center mb-10">
                    <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dcam-website.appspot.com/o/blog_images%2Fhow-music-intervals-work%2Fc_major_scale.png?alt=media&token=bd533e05-f8cd-4f01-aca3-567183587c83" alt="harmonic interval example" className="rounded-md md:w-[55%]" />
                </figure>
                <p className="leading-8 mb-10">As you might already know, every major scale follows the same pattern of whole steps and half steps, which means that the distance relationship between the notes is the same across all major scales. Keeping this fact in mind, here are the names of intervals between notes of the major scale (using "C" as our reference point). Let's do our best to memorize these:</p>
                <figure className="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col justify-center items-center mb-10">
                    <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dcam-website.appspot.com/o/blog_images%2Fhow-music-intervals-work%2Fmajor_intervals.jpg?alt=media&token=cb696cd8-c688-443d-a850-b829350d75d7" alt="harmonic interval example" className="rounded-md md:w-[45%]" />
                </figure>
                <p className="leading-8 mb-10">Several important observations can be made from the above chart:</p>
                    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-10 leading-8">
                        <li className="font-bold">The 1st, 4th, 5th and 8th intervals are all PERFECT</li><br />
                        <li className="font-bold">The 2nd, 3rd, 6th and 7th intervals are all MAJOR</li>
                    </ol>
                <p className="leading-8 mb-10">This pattern holds true for any major scale and is the key to naming intervals!</p>
                <p className="leading-8 mb-12">Okay, so we understand what "major" and "perfect" intervals are, but what about the others: "minor", "diminished" and "augmented"? The remaining three interval types can be thought of as deriving from the first two. The following table illustrates how we get "minor", "diminished" and "augmented" intervals from "major" and "perfect" intervals:</p>
                <table className="mx-auto bg-gray-100 w-full md:w-[50%] blog-table mb-12">

                Counting up from the lower note (G) to the higher note (C) gives us 4, so our interval size is a "4th". Now, let's think about its quality. Because our lowest note is "G", we are going to assume that we are in the key of "G Major". Our knowledge of major scales tells us that "G Major" only has an "F#", which means the note "C" is natural in this scale (just as it is in our interval). From the table above, we know that in any major scale, the interval between the tonic note and the 4th note is called "perfect". Therefore, we can safely conclude that our interval is a <span className="font-bold">Perfect 4th</span>.</p>

                Counting up from the lower note (D) to the higher note (A#) gives us 5, so our interval size is a "5th". Now, let's think about its quality. Because our lower note is "D", we assume that we are in the key of "D Major". "D Major" has 2 sharps: "F#" and "C#", with all the other notes being natural. So, if our "A" was natural, the interval would be a "Perfect 5th". But our "A" is in fact sharp, meaning it was moved up by 1 half step. From the table above, we know that when a "Perfect" interval is raised by 1 half step, it becomes "Augmented". Therefore, we can safely conclude that our interval is an <span className="font-bold">Augmented 5th</span>.</p>

                This one looks a bit disorienting at first, as the first note is higher than the second. But we should not let that stop us - remember, we always start counting from the lower note, which in this case is "F". Counting up from "F" to "D" gives us a 6, so our interval size is a "6th". Now, let's think about the quality. The key of "F Major" only has a "B♭" in it, which means the "D" is natural. If our "D" was also natural, the interval would be a "Major 6th". However, our "D" has been lowered by 1 half step to "D♭". Remembering our interval table, we know that a major interval lowered by 1 half step becomes a minor interval. Therefore, we can safely conclude that our interval is a <span className="font-bold">Minor 6th</span>.</p>

                Counting up from "A" to "G" gives us 7, so we know that our interval is some kind of 7th. Now for the quality. I chose this example on purpose because students often get stuck on this type of interval. The problem is, there isn't really an "A# Major" key in the standard list of major keys. So what are we supposed to do? The trick here is to temporarily imagine that "A" has no sharp and treat it as just an "A". From here, we know that "A Major" scale has 3 sharps: "F#", "C#", and "G#". So if our "G" was sharp, the interval would be a major 7th (assuming we are in "A major"). Because our "G" has no sharp, it means it is 1 half step smaller, meaning that our interval (so far) is in fact a "Minor 7th". But we are not finished yet. It's only a "Minor 7th" if our bottom note is "A", but it is actually an "A#". Referring back to Figure 2.0, we learn that a minor interval made 1 half step smaller becomes "diminished". Therefore, we can safely conclude that our interval is a <span className="font-bold">Diminished 7th</span>.</p>

                Counting up from "E" to "B" gives us 5, so we know that our interval is some kind of 5th. Our bottom note is "E♭", so we will assume we are in the key of "E♭ Major". The key signature of "E♭ Major" is "B♭", "E♭" and "A♭". So, if our "B" was flat, then our interval would be a "Perfect 5th". Our B is, in fact, flat. Therefore, we can safely conclude that our interval is a <span className="font-bold">Perfect 5th</span>.</p>

                        <p>Identifying intervals on a music staff is nice and dandy, but what happens when we can only hear them? Can we learn to identify music intervals by sound alone? Yes we can! In fact, being able to identify intervals aurally is even more useful for musicians from a practical sense, such as when they want to play something that they heard on their instrument. Because most of us do not have the gift of "perfect pitch" (which would allow us to identify intervals quite easily and instantly), we are going to focus here on how to do it using what is called "relative pitch".</p>

                <p className="leading-8 mb-10"><span className="font-bold">Relative pitch</span> refers to the ability to identify a particular note (or interval) by using another note as a reference. In other words, we are identifying the second note "relative" to the first note.</p>
                <p className="leading-8 mb-14"><span className="italic">But how can I know what the first note is? Don't you need "perfect pitch" for that?</span> Actually, it is absolutely unnecessary to know what the first note is in order to identify an interval. All you need to be able to do is judge the distance between the two notes. To help us do that, we are going to use songs! That's right, songs that you very likely already know and can recall at will. For every interval, I am going to give you an example of a song that uses it. Once you learn to associate an interval to a specific song, you should be able to identify any interval like a pro!</p>
