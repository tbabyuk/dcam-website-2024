                <p className="mb-6">Sure starting to learn piano as a child may have its benefits, but not all of us had parents who made us take piano lessons as kids. Or, perhaps some of us started with another instrument but have always secretly wanted to play the piano, and now we&apos;ve finally found time to do it! Whatever your situation was - good on you for finally making the decision to take up piano! Piano is truly an amazing instrument (I am not biased, I swear!) that can bring immeasurable joy and pleasure to your life and learning it is worth it no matter what age you are.</p>
                <p>In this guide, I aim to dispel the common myth surrounding adult piano learners and arm you with advice and resources that, if used, will make your piano learning faster, funner, and more effective! Above all - I wish you luck and success with your piano studies!</p>

                        <p>This is the most common (and unproductive) argument that many adults use to justify not starting to learn the piano. If you have found yourself with this thought, ask yourself: why do I want to learn the piano? Is it to become a concert pianist? Well, in that case yes, it might be a bit late for that. Or, as is the case with most people, maybe you want to learn mainly for yourself and perhaps to be able to entertain family members and friends? In that case, age is absolutely not a factor. Just as not everyone who plays soccer becomes a professional soccer player, so not everyone who plays the piano becomes a professional pianist. Do it for yourself!</p>

                <p className="mb-14">When it comes to learning the piano (or any other instrument for that matter), adults in fact have several advantages that children don&apos;t. Here are some of the most important ones:</p>

                        <p>Most children take lessons because their parents make them, not necessarily because they asked for them. With adults, the situation is reversed. This is an important distinction as it means you are going to be motivated to learn, which increases your chances of success.</p>

                        <p>Here is a shocking fact: the most successful students are those who make practicing a routine. If you are serious about learning the piano, you can find at least 20 minutes a day (or every other day if you are super busy) to practice. Remember: shorter practice sessions 4 or 5 times a week yield much better results than longer practice sessions once or twice a week.</p>

                        <p>Sure, you are an adult and you might feel pressure to learn as fast as you can to "catch up". But this kind of attitude is often unproductive and can lead to feelings of anxiety and burnout. In addition, it might make you try and take short-cuts at the piano, skipping over material that is fundamental to the development of proper technique. Remember the answer to the good old question about how to eat an elephant: “one bite at a time”.</p>

                    <p>This is an axiom that applies to many aspects of life, but in learning an instrument it&apos;s especially relevant. It is easy to feel discouraged or inferior after watching a YouTube video of a concert pianist or a child prodigy. But don&apos;t let this daunt you in any way. You should only compare yourself today to yourself yesterday and be proud of the progress you are making, no matter how small.</p>

Playing material that you feel passionate about is a great motivator and will also give you and your teacher a clear goal to work towards.</p>
