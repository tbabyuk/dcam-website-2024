                            <li>learning from videos (e.g. YouTube, music-based websites)</li>

                            <li>learning from a teacher via a video connection (Skype, Zoom, etc.)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In this article, we are using the third meaning of &quot;online lessons&quot; - <span className="font-semibold">learning one-on-one from a teacher via a video connection</span>.</p>

Music lessons have certainly not escaped this new trend, but the question many music teachers, students, and parents are asking is: how effective are online music lessons vs. traditional, in-person lessons?</p>
                <p className="leading-8 mb-6">For both studies, student perceptions of their teacher and of the effectiveness of their course in general was slightly higher for the &quot;classroom&quot; group than the &quot;online&quot; group. But when researchers compared the two groups on &quot;learning outcomes&quot; (i.e. their actual test results and final grades), they did not find any significant differences.</p>
                <p className="leading-8 mb-6">In simple terms, what these results tell us is that <span className="font-bold">although students appear to enjoy in-person lessons slightly more than online lessons, the amount of learning that takes place is essentially the same</span>. This is an important point, as many parents wrongly assume that children don&apos;t learn as much from online lessons as from in-person lessons.</p>

                </figure>
                <p className="leading-8 mb-6">Although most music students would benefit equally well from any of the two lesson formats, here are two situations where we strongly recommend in-person lessons:</p>
                <p className="font-bold leading-8">1. Small children just starting out on their instrument (and to a lesser degree, beginner adult students)</p> 
                <p className="leading-8 mb-6">The reason for this simple: it is critical that a student forms correct playing habits (mainly posture, hand position, finger technique) from the very beginning of their musical studies, as these can significantly enhance or hinder their future progress as musicians. For this to happen correctly and effectively, teachers must have the ability to physically correct (and keep correcting for as long as necessary) any perceivable mistakes in these three areas. Once correct foundational habits have been put into place, students should be able to benefit from online lessons just as much as from in-person lessons.</p>
                <p className="leading-8 font-bold">2. Students intending to pursue music professionally</p> 
                <p className="leading-8">For children whose parents want them to pursue musical professionally, in-person lessons with a well-qualified instructor are their best option. At the end of the day, online lessons simply cannot provide the amount of detailed feedback necessary for absolute musical mastery as traditional, in-person lessons.</p>

                <p className="leading-8">In summary, if you love music and want to learn to play an instrument primarily for your own enjoyment, online lessons are as good of an option as in-person lessons. However, for students who might want to pursue music professionally and for young children just starting out on their instrument, in-person lessons are strongly recommended.</p>
