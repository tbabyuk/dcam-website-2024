                <p className="mb-6">Most people know of Chopin as the famous Romantic-era composer, but what about Chopin the pianist? Just how good was he at the piano and what were perhaps some peculiarities of his piano playing?</p>
                <p className="mb-6">Because there was no sound-recording technology in Chopin&apos;s time, we cannot answer this question by just listening to him play. Instead, we are going to have to rely on three sources: his biography, his compositions, and statements of his contemporaries.</p>

                        <p className="leading-8">All biographical accounts of Chopin&apos;s life tell us that he was a child prodigy at the piano. This means he must have displayed natural ability at the instrument from a very early age. By age five he is said to have absorbed everything his elder sister taught him at the piano and by seven he started playing before the public.</p>

                        <p className="leading-8">Chopin&apos;s musical output is a great indication of his mastery at the piano. Anyone who has played Chopin&apos;s repertoire (especially his more advanced works) will not fail to appreciate the complexity and technical demands of many of his works.</p><br />
                        <p className="leading-8">Take as an example this excerpt from his "Etude Op. 24, No. 6 in G# minor":</p>

                <p>This is considered to be one of Chopin&apos;s hardest etudes to play because of all the double thirds in the RH. But this speaks volumes to Chopin&apos;s prowess at the piano. We know that Chopin was able to play and often played his own compositions.</p>

                    <p>Apparently, one distinctive feature of Chopin&apos;s playing was his rubato.</p><br />
                    <p>Chopin&apos;s friend and student <span className="font-bold">Wilhelm Von Lenz</span> said: <span className="italic">“A remarkable feature of his playing was the entire freedom with which he treated the rhythm, but which appeared so natural that for years it had never struck me. It must have been in 1845 or 1846 that I once ventured to observe to him that most of his mazurkas (those dainty jewels) when played by himself appeared to be written not in 3/4 but in 4/4 time, the result of his dwelling so much longer on the first note of the bar. He denied it strenuously, until I made him play one of them and counted audibly four in the bar, which fitted perfectly. Then he laughed and explained that it was the national character of the dance which created the oddity.”</span></p><br />
                    <p>On the same topic of rubato, <span className="font-bold">Salaman</span> wrote after hearing Chopin play in 1848: <span className="italic">“in spite of all I had heard of Chopin&apos;s tempo rubato, I still recollect noting how precise he was in the matter of time, accent and rhythm, even when playing most passionately, fancifully and rhapsodically.”</span></p>

                    <ArticleSubheadingRed subheading='4. His playing often lacked "sonority" or "resonance"' align="text-left" bottom="mb-10" />
                    <p>One potential criticism of Chopin&apos;s playing was its lack of “sonority/resonance”. He was sometimes criticized for playing “too softly” or “too delicately”, or so it seemed to audiences who were used to a more forceful way of playing. According to author Harold C. Schonberg, <span className="italic">“This lack of sonority was the single defect in Chopin&apos;s equipment - if it was a defect.”</span> Perhaps Chopin was aware of this and for this reason preferred to play in salons, where he was sure everybody would be able to hear him, rather than big concert halls.</p>
