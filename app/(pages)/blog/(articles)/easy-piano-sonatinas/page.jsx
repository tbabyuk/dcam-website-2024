                    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">The Sonatina</h2>
                    <p className="leading-8 mb-5">A sonatina is a musical composition resembling a mini-sonata. Where a sonata is considered a sophisticated and relatively complex piece of music, a sonatina is a lot shorter, lighter in character, and less technically-demanding. In fact, composers generally wrote sonatinas precisely for this purpose - as teaching material for their students. For this reason, most piano teachers will have their students learn several sonatinas before jumping into actual sonatas. That way, students will be much more prepared to handle a sonata (and other more complicated musical works) both technically and intellectually.</p><br />
                    <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Note to teacher/student:</h2>
                    <p className="leading-8">There are of course quite a few sonatinas to choose from. In this article, my purpose is to help you make this choice easier by introducing you to three sonatinas that are considered on the easier side and which I have enjoyed playing and teaching to my students over the years. It's important to keep in mind that sonatinas would not be appropriate for complete beginners. A student must be at least a high beginner/low intermediate level to begin to tackle a sonatina. Also, although sonatinas normally contain 3 (and sometimes 2) movements, it is rare for a student to actually learn all the movements. Most often, only one movement is learned. Music exams at the low intermediate level also generally specify that only one movement is to be performed.</p><br />

                            <p><span className="font-semibold">Muzio Clementi</span> (1752-1832) was an Italian-born English pianist, composer, teacher, and conductor among many other things. Out of his considerable compositional output, his sonatinas in particular have enjoyed considerable success and are widely used even to this day in piano teaching.</p><br />
                            <p>The sonatina featured here is the first and the easiest of the six contained in his Op. 36. For this reason, this is usually one of the very first sonatinas I have my students learn (usually just the 1st movement).</p><br />
                            <p><span className="italic">Interesting fact</span>: In 1781, Clementi participated in a musical contest with Mozart in Vienna, where they took turns performing and improvising at the harpsichord for the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. The emperor declared it a tie!</p>
