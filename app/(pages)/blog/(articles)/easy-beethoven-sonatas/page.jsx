                    <p className="leading-8">Let's get something straight - when we talk about “easy” Beethoven sonatas, we are of course talking about easy relative the rest of his sonatas, of which he is known to have written about 32. The first two sonatas you will see here are almost universally agreed to be his easiest, while the third one is not so obvious. There were definitely several contenders for the third place, so after the technical considerations, my choice in the end came down to my own personal taste, which I hope you will share and appreciate!</p><br />
                    <p className="leading-8">So if you can't wait to finally try your hand at a Beethoven sonata, here are some some great options for you to start with. Happy playing!</p>

                        <p>This is the first of two sonatas nicknamed “Leichte Sonaten”, which is German for “Easy Sonatas” (the second one will be covered next). Because of their relative ease, these sonatas are thought to have been written for Beethoven's students. Though composed around 1795-1796, they were not published until 1805, when Beethoven's brother Kaspar took them to the publishing house against Beethoven's wishes. Thank you, Kaspar!</p>

                        <p>Okay, let's be honest - this one is quite a jump from the first two sonatas. But hey, why not challenge yourself a bit? Think of this one as the easiest of the “hard sonatas”. By looking at the Quick Facts alone, you will see that it has 4 movements instead of just 2 of our previous sonatas, as well as a more demanding key. You will also notice that it's considered two RCM levels above the previous two sonatas (level 10 vs. level 8), which reflects its bigger technical demands. If it looks a bit intimidating to you, I definitely recommend starting with one of the first two. But if you're up to the challenge - then dive in!</p>
