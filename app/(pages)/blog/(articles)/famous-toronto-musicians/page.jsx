The Weeknd's journey to fame started when he uploaded some of this first songs to YouTube in 2010. These got positive feedback from listeners, and subsequently received even more exposure when Drake (our other featured Torontonian) included them in a blog post. Encouraged, The Weeknd continued to release new material and soon began touring with Drake, often performing as his opening act. The rest, as they say, is history. Today, The Weeknd has managed to cultivate his own unique musical style as he keeps delighting fans with one hit after another.</p>

                        <p>Born in Toronto on September 25, 1932, Glenn Gould was one of the most-celebrated and respected classical pianists of the 20th century. A child prodigy at the piano, he passed his Royal Conservatory examinations at just 12 years old. Gould was especially known for his interpretations of the works of J. S. Bach, though his repertoire also included works by Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, and Brahms. Aside from his musical genius, Gould was also known for his many eccentricities: he hummed while playing, hated being touched, hated the cold, was a hypochondriac, and disliked social functions, among others. Despite this, he remains one of Toronto's most impressive musical talents.</p>
