                        <p>Born in Toronto on September 25, 1932, Glenn Gould was one of the most-celebrated and respected classical pianists of the 20th century. A child prodigy at the piano, he passed all of his <a href="https://www.rcmusic.com/" target="_blank" className="dcam-link">Royal Conservatory of Music</a> examinations at just 12 years of age. Gould was best known for his interpretations of the works of J. S. Bach, though his repertoire also included works by Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, and Brahms. Aside from his musical genius, Gould was also known for his many eccentricities: he hummed while playing, hated being touched, didn&apos;t like the cold, was a hypochondriac, and disliked social functions, among others. Despite this, Glenn Gould remains one of Canada&apos;s most impressive musical talents.</p>

                        <p>Oscar Peterson was a famous Canadian jazz pianist who is considered one of the great jazz pianists of all time. Born in Montreal, Quebec, in 1925, he enjoyed a long musical career spanning more than six decades. Peterson&apos;s initial training was in classical piano, but he soon discovered his love for jazz and boogie-woogie and began shifting his focus to these. In his youth, he is said to have spent many hours a day at the piano, honing his technical skills as well his improvisation. In 1940, aged 14, Peterson won the national music competition organized by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Gaining confidence in his ability, he ended up dropping out of high school to pursue a career in music, and never looked back. In additional to thousands of performances, Peterson also did numerous recordings and collaborations with the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and others.</p>

                        <p>Jan Lisiecki is a contemporary Polish-Canadian classical pianist from Calgary, Alberta. Born in 1995, he is the youngest pianist on our list. Jan showed great talent from a young age and made his orchestral debut at the age of 9. At 13, he performed the Chopin Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 21 at the 2008 “Chopin and his Europe” festival in Warsaw, which was a big success and earned him a return invite the following year. These performances were later released as recordings, which brought plenty of positive attention to the young pianist. At 15, he signed an exclusive contract with the German music label Deutsche Grammophon. Jan continues to produce recordings and has an active performance schedule all over the world.</p>
