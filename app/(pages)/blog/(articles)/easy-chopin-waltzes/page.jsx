                    <p className="leading-8">Although Chopin is known to have written a total of about 20 waltzes, most of them require a pre-advanced to advanced mastery of the piano to be able to perform comfortably. Luckily, there are 3 that are easier than the others in difficulty level, and should be very manageable for intermediate and high-intermediate level students (think at least 3 years of consistent piano playing). They are: “Waltz in A Minor, op. posth., B 150”, “Waltz in B minor, op. 69, no. 2”, and “Waltz in A flat Major, op. 69, no. 1 ("L'adieu')". Although less technically-demanding than his other waltzes, they are just as beautiful!</p><br />
