                        <p className="leading-8 mb-6">If your child is studying music in Canada (or the U.S. to a lesser extent), chances are you have heard about RCM (Royal Conservatory) exams. But what exactly are these exams and are they the right choice for your child? Having gone through the RCM system myself and prepared numerous students for these exams, I have compiled for your benefit my top six reasons for doing RCM exams!</p>
                        <p>*While this article focuses on children, keep in mind that RCM exams are open to music students of all ages!*</p>

                        <p className="leading-8">The RCM Certificate Program has been carefully designed to ensure that students get exposed to a wide variety of musical styles and genres. You can expect to play inventions, minuets, sonatinas, sonatas, and nocturnes, just to name a few. In addition, the co-requisite theory, history, and harmony exams that begin at intermediate levels help ensure that students also know about how music works and how it evolved.</p>

This means students achieve results and progress much faster on their instruments that those not partaking in an exam program.</p>

All RCM examiners are professionals in their field, so you can be sure that the feedback you get is valuable and will tell your child exactly what they need to do to improve.</p>

The specifics differ depending on the province, but in Ontario, where we are located, students can earn 2 out of the 30 credits required to graduate by successfully completing the RCM Gr. 7 and Gr. 8 practical exams along with their theory co-requisites.

For US test takers, it is up to each state/school board to decide whether to count successful completion of RCM examinations towards high school credits.</p>
