            <p>Our teachers are all qualified professionals and passionate musicians. We do our best to match a student with a teacher that we think would best fit their musical goals as well as their personalities. We understand that while some students prefer a relaxed teaching approach, there are always those for whom a more strict approach is more effective. Students also have the option to request to change their teacher if they wish to do so. Learn more about our teachers on our <Link href="/teachers" className="dcam-link">Teachers Section</Link>.</p>
