            <p><strong>Private lessons</strong>: these are one-on-one lessons with student and teacher. Private lessons are a great option for students looking for highly-focused and individualized music instruction. The teacher is able to give their full attention to one student and students normally progress faster in this environment.<br /><br />
            <strong>Semi-private lessons</strong>: these lessons consist of two students per teacher. Semi-private lessons can be a budget-friendly option for parents with two children or two friends wanting to learn the same instrument together. The one obvious drawback is that students don&apos;t receive as much focused and individualized attention from the teacher as they do with private lessons.</p>
