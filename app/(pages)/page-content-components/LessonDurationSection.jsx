            <p>At DCAM, students can choose between 30-minute, 45-minute, or 1-hour lessons. Small children generally start with 30-minute lessons and increase lesson duration as they get older and/or with the recommendation from their teacher. For teenagers and adults, a minimum lesson time of 45 minutes is strongly recommended.</p>
