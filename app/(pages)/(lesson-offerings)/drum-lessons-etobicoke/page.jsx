                    <p>Whether you want to play in a band, improve your sense of rhythm, or just let out some steam - there is no denying that drums are just an all-round fun instrument to play!<br /><br /> In our studio, we incorporate real song tracks into our lessons so that you get a genuine playing experience. Students can also choose to play either an acoustic or electric drum set, or alternate between both!</p>

                <p>At 6, most children are grown enough to have a comfortable reach around the drums and are mentally ready to get the maximum benefit from their lessons. However, if your child is younger and you think they are ready to start, we would be happy to give them a free trial lesson and give you our recommendation.</p>

                    <p>Beginning students can start out with our “Intro to Guitar” book series, which includes 3 books. These books help lay all the important foundation for beginning guitarists, including the reading of tablature, strumming patterns, and lots of fun songs to play along to! After completing the series, students are free to start learning songs that interest them and can join our “Band Experience” program, which allows them to get a feel for what it's like to play in a group with other instruments and musicians.</p>
