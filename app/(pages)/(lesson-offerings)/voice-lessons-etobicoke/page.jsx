                <PageSubtitle subtitle="What is a good age to start voice lessons?" />
                <p>Age 7 and up is a good time for children to begin singing lessons. At this age children are mature enough and have enough awareness of their own body to be able to follow the teacher's instructions. Although their voice has not yet matured at this age, they will benefit greatly from developing proper singing habits and techniques that they can continue to apply as they get older. At this age, teachers are careful not to put too much pressure on the vocal chords to avoid causing unnecessary strain.</p>

                    <p>Students have the option of purchasing one of our method books or bringing in their own material. Those wishing to go the Royal Conservatory route might want to focus on RCM materials, otherwise a teacher can help the student select a book most suitable to their needs and goals. Some teachers also choose to use their own material that they have accumulated over time and found to be effective with their students.</p>

                <p>Students can choose from a wide variety of genres such as pop, jazz, and blues. Very often students will have a specific song they would like to learn to sing, which are teachers are more than happy to help with.</p>
