                    <p>Quoting from the RCM Theory Syllabus (2016), <span className="italic">“The study of theory is an essential component of well-rounded musical training and is intended to support the practical studies to enhance and enrich the musical experience.”</span> We absolutely agree with this statement!<br /><br />At DCAM, you can take Music Theory as a separate lesson or in combination with the study of your favourite instrument.</p>

                <p>Students can begin studying the basics of music theory as young as 5 years old. Getting an early start in music theory gives young students an edge when the get into the more complicated material.</p>

                    <p>Since many of our students eventually intend to write the RCM theory exams, RCM books are our most popular choice for theory studies. However, there are plenty of other great theory books out there which we would be happy to teach if that is what our students would prefer. One example of such books is Barbara Wharram's “Rudimentary Rudiments of Music”.</p>
